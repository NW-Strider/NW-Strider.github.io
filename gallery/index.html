    <p>An effort to bridge the gap between the natural and unnatural through human connection, Entangled is a physical structure that employs wood, wire, 3D-printed items, as well as interactive lights and sounds. The exhibit was originally installed in the TRANslab of Elings Hall, but is in the process of moving to the Glassbox Gallery on campus. Our work addresses AI and equity by promoting inclusivity and accessibility. he installation invites viewers to engage with both natural and technological elements, reflecting the dynamic relationship between humans and machines. As participants interact, their movements are captured and translated into data using TouchDesigner, controlling pane of flowers under the viewer. This visual feedback loop highlights the mutual influence of human actions and AI, demonstrating how technology can foster deeper connections. The interactive design ensures a wide audience can participate, showcasing AI as a tool that enhances human experiences without exclusion.   </p>
