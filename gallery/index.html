    <p>My final project for MAT 111PF consists of 11 3D printed flowers, several 3D printed TPU "vines", and several laser-cut "squiggles" made of wood. I made these with the intention of using them in another project, "Entangled", as well as the "Sound Garden", both of which can be seen below. These 3D printed items vary in size as well as design, as there are three different flowers and three different wooden shapes. This project was originally unnamed, however, I thought "Bouquet" was fitting as the project turns into a "Garden".</p>

    <p>An idea inspired by the pieces created for the Entangled project, this Sound Garden is an exploration of my own curiosity into the relationship between colors, shapes, and sounds. I was heavily inspired by synesthesia art as well as one very specific scene in the movie "Ratatouille". In this project, I used the 3D models of each flower design and generated two sets of Euclidean rhythms based on different criteria. The first rhythm for each design was the one I hear when looking at the shape of the flower while the second was based on color theory. I had created color pallets for each flower based on how I imagined them, and made the second Euclidean rhythm based on what notes corresponded with each color and tempo.  </p>

    <p>An effort to bridge the gap between the natural and unnatural through human connection, Entangled is a physical structure that employs wood, wire, 3D-printed items, as well as interactive lights and sounds. The exhibit was originally installed in the TRANslab of Elings Hall, but is in the process of moving to the Glassbox Gallery on campus. Our work addresses AI and equity by promoting inclusivity and accessibility. he installation invites viewers to engage with both natural and technological elements, reflecting the dynamic relationship between humans and machines. As participants interact, their movements are captured and translated into data using TouchDesigner, controlling pane of flowers under the viewer. This visual feedback loop highlights the mutual influence of human actions and AI, demonstrating how technology can foster deeper connections. The interactive design ensures a wide audience can participate, showcasing AI as a tool that enhances human experiences without exclusion.   </p>
